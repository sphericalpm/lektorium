## Code Of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Atom Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

1. We treat everyone and each as a friend and with respect. In particular: personal attacks, insulting, indignity for any reason, critics and stereotyping on the basis of personal attributes the receiver cannot change (such as gender, age, health condition, sexual orientation, etc) are not allowed. We keep close to each other, joke, fool around and have fun from our interaction, keeping within the limits described above.

2. We work as a team. Do not compete or brag about any of our qualities, except the one of how well we support others and how we share our knowledge. Help to your colleagues is the most important KPI!

3. There is no such thing as a stupid question. Repetitive questions can be annoying but never stupid.

4. We say what we think and do what we say. [Self-] deception, especially in assessing own abilities does not make any sense: everything is here to learn something new, and in order to improve one needs to know the true baseline.

5. We don't owe anything to one another, except what we had promised. Consequently, we do not promise what we can not handle or are not going to do.

6. While point 4 above is very important, we understand that everyone has their day job, study, family, and other  sources of unforeseen circumstances. If something affects work to be done, we do not quarrel but try to find ways to help our colleague and the project. If such "oopses" occur too often, we review how much time this colleague can actually contribute to the project, and act accordingly.

7. Code quality is its most important characteristic. It is always better to take longer than to contribute produce substandard code. It is worth to ask for help from your teammate than declare code you are not sure about as done. We respect each other's time and we do not declare code finished unless it meets basic quality requirements (it builds, runs, is adequately covered with tests, complies to basic style guides, etc).

8. The whole codebase belongs to all of us. Everyone looks at their own code as critically as at someone else's, and  does not defend own code from legitimate criticism. The author is always eager to receive critique of their code and is grateful for such critique.

9. We accept [Michael](https://github.com/mvartanyan) and [Max](https://github.com/jekoff) as an imaginary customer voice. Technical decision making we make together.

10. Any proposals can and should be voiced, considered and debated. When the decision is taken,  we are moving accordingly without deviation, except something previously unknown affects on the context in which the decision was taken. In such cases, we reconsider the decision. It happens and that is totally fine!
