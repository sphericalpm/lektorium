[What should I know before I get started?](#what-should-i-know-before-i-get-started)

## What should I know before I get started?
1. We treat everyone and each as a friend and with respect. In particular: personal attacks, insulting, indignity for any reason, critics and stereotyping on the basis of personal attributes the receiver cannot change (such as gender, age, health condition, sexual orientation, etc) are not allowed. We keep close to each other, joke, fool around and have fun from our interaction, keeping within the limits described above.

2. We work as a team. Do not compete and not measure by any quality, except how well we give support to others and how we share our knowledge. Help your colleagues is the most important KPI!

3. We say what we think and do what we say. [Self-] deception, especially in assessing own abilities does not make any sense: everything is here to learn something new, and in order to improve one needs to know the true baseline.

4. Nobody owes anything, except what he had promised. Consequently, we do not promise what we can not handle or not going to do.

5. While point 4 above is very important, we understand that everyone has their day job, study, family, and other  sources of unforeseen circumstances. If something affects work to be done, we do not quarrel but try to find ways to help our colleague and the project. If such "oopses" occur too often, we review how much time this colleague can actually contribute to the project, and act accordingly.

6. Code quality is the most important characteristic. It is better longer than the worst. It is worth to ask for help from your teammate than insist on code that you are not quite sure. We respect each other and do not declare code finished, which does not meet basic quality requirements (does not compile, launch, cover adequately by tests, fit with basic style guides, etc).

7. All codebase is our common code. Everyone threat his code as critical as someone's else code does not protect it from legitimate criticism. Eager for someone to criticize his code and thank for such criticizing.

8. We accept [Michael](https://github.com/mvartanyan) and [Max](https://github.com/jekoff) as an imaginary customer voice. Technical decision making we make together.

9. Any proposals can and should be voiced, considered and debated. When the decision is taken,  we are moving accordingly without deviation, except something previously unknown affects on the context in which the decision was taken. In such cases, we reconsider the decision. It happens and that is totally fine!
