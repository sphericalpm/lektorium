## What should I know before I get started?
1. We treat everyone and each as a friend and with respect. Particularly: taking it personally, insulting, indignity by any reason, critics and compilation personal attributes, which receiver cannot change (such as sex, age, health condition, sexual orientation, etc) are not allowed. We keep close to each other, joke, fool around and have fun from interaction, but in the frame what's written above.

2. We work as a team. Do not compete and not measure by any quality, except how well we give support to others and how we share our knowledge. Help your colleagues is the most important KPI!

3. We speak what we think and do accordingly. [Self-] deception, especially in measuring own abilities does not make any sense: everything here exists to learn something new, but one needs to know basics.

4. Nobody owes anything, except what he had promised. Consequently, we do not promise what we can not handle or not going to do.

5. Point 4 is very important. We understand that everyone has his main work, study, family, and other bunch sources of unforeseen circumstances. If something affects work to be done we do not argue but try to find ways to help person particularly and overall project. If such "unforeseen" occur too often - we discuss how much time this person can truly spend on the project and act accordingly.

6. Code quality is the most important characteristic. It is better longer than the worst. It is worth to ask for help from your teammate than insist on code that you are not quite sure. We respect each other and do not declare code finished, which does not meet basic quality requirements (does not compile, launch, cover adequately by tests, fit with basic style guides, etc).

7. All codebase is our common code. Everyone threat his code as critical as someone's else code does not protect it from legitimate criticism. Eager for someone to criticize his code and thank for such criticizing.

8. We accept https://github.com/mvartanyan and https://github.com/jekoff as an imaginary customer voice. Technical decision making we make together.

9. All proposals may and must be expressed, considered and argued. When the decision is established we are moving accordingly without deviation, except something previously was unknown what affects on the entire landscape. In such cases we reconsider the decision. It happens and that is totally fine!
